Your {{ .Chart.Name }} deployment named {{ .Release.Name }} is now deployed.

To check automated genesis ceremony status:

    $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} logs -f job/{{ include "creditchain-genesis.fullname" . }}-e{{ .Values.chain.era }}

The resulting genesis ConfigMaps can be mounted by creditchain-node, and will be located at:

{{- range $user := .Values.genesis.users }}
    - {{ $user.name }}-genesis-e{{ $.Values.chain.era }}
{{- end  }}
